## Description
The purpose of this project was to create a web app that was capable of taking in 3 employee factors. First name, last name and salary. The application will ask the user for these 3 items. The user will then be asked if they want to add other employees until they have inserted enough information. When the user selects cancel; the app will alert the user what the average salary is and will select a random employee in another alert. The app will then insert all the information into a spreadsheet on the page alphabetically.

## Usage

To start, click the "Add Employee" button. Type in First name, last name, and salary amount. Answer prompt message and repeat until you are done.
